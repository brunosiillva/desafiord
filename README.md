## Instaling

To make this project run locally is very easy to do, first you only have to clone this repository inside the folder that you use as a local server, after that you only have to start the local server and open the index.html file in your browser.

## Development

I've used some frameworks to develop the challange, making it fast to develop. I used to Bootstrap4 for some elements to UI (buttons, inputs, selects, forms, headers...), the AngularJS 1.6+ for gettign data to Google Books and make the sytem to works like SPA without reload when change the routs (As the project needed to simple i chose the AngularJS because it is a lighwheight tool compared to others tools) and i used jQuery to make some DOM manipulations.
